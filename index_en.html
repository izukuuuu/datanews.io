                            China has always welcomed students from all over the world to come and study here. We
                            provide a range of incentives for international students, including scholarships, simplified
                            visa procedures, and expanded employment opportunities. With China's growing international
                            stature, the number of international students coming to China is increasing year by year.
                            While international students enjoy the convenience we offer, they also need to adapt to
                            China's culture and way of life. This is a two-way process and an important way for the
                            world to understand China.

                                    Cultural adaptation refers to the process by which individuals, after entering a new
                                    cultural environment, gradually adjust to the new cultural norms and values through
                                    learning and adaptation. This process aims to reduce cultural conflicts and stress,
                                    ultimately improving satisfaction and efficiency in daily life and work. Cultural
                                    adaptation is a complex and dynamic process influenced by various factors related to
                                    individuals and their environment. International students in China, as
                                    cross-cultural individuals, experience a complex and dynamic cultural adaptation
                                    process influenced by multiple factors related to individuals and their environment.

                                In addition to language barriers, international students in China also have to deal with
                                differences between Eastern and Western cultures.<br> These cultural differences, often
                                unnoticed, can lead to feelings of cultural conflict, cultural loss, or cultural
                                alienation among international students.
                                <br>
                                In this study, we also found that the majority of international students in China prefer
                                to use foreign social platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.<br>
                                In contrast, their engagement on mainstream Chinese social platforms is relatively low,
                                with only about 10% of the respondents using platforms like Douyin, Weibo, Bilibili, and
                                Xiaohongshu.
                                <br>
                                Exploring the reasons behind this phenomenon further, many respondents mentioned that
                                they prefer using foreign social platforms because they are already accustomed to them,
                                and because Chinese social platforms differ significantly in terms of functionality and
                                usage habits from the platforms they are familiar with.

                                "I feel a sense of belonging when using foreign social platforms because I can stay in
                                touch with my friends from home. On Chinese social platforms, I might feel a bit

                                As for why they don't use domestic platforms like Xiaohongshu or Weibo, many respondents
                                also mentioned difficulties related to usage, with one respondent stating:

                                they encounter while using these platforms may affect their interactions with Chinese
                                netizens and create inconvenience in accessing information.

                        In our survey, Mary, an international student from France, was deeply captivated by Chinese
                        calligraphy during her studies in China. She not only diligently practiced it herself but also
                        actively introduced the art of calligraphy to her friends in France.
                        After returning to France, Mary, along with like-minded friends, established a calligraphy

                        with friends from around the world. For example, during the Spring Festival, international

                        featuring traditions like pasting couplets, making dumplings, and setting off firecrackers.

                        As the global pandemic gradually comes under control, the lives of international students in
                        China will return to normal. During the pandemic, many international students had to engage in
                        online learning and remote communication with their teachers and peers in their home countries.
                        While this mode of communication allowed them to continue their studies, it couldn't replace
                        face-to-face interaction and engagement.
                        In the post-pandemic era, we hope that international students in China will actively participate
                        in cross-cultural communication. In their studies and daily lives, they can proactively engage
                        with people from different countries and regions, understanding diverse cultures and ways of
                        thinking. This will not only broaden their horizons but also enhance their cross-cultural
                        communication skills.
                        Additionally, we hope that international students can use their pandemic experiences to explore
                        new ways of cross-cultural communication. For example, they can organize cross-cultural exchange
                        activities through online communication platforms, involving more people. They can also use
                        social media tools to build cross-cultural communities, promoting interaction and communication
                        between different cultures.
                        In the field of cross-cultural communication, we also need to provide psychological support and
                        counseling to international students. Many of them face various pressures and challenges, such
                        as loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Therefore, it's necessary to offer appropriate
                        psychological support and counseling to help them better adapt to their new environment,
                        alleviate stress, and manage negative emotions.

                        International students in China are not only ambassadors of cultural exchange but also promoters
                        of Chinese culture. We hope that through cultural interactions, they can better spread Chinese
                        culture to a global audience, allowing more people to understand and appreciate China.
                        By organizing relevant activities, international students can deeply study and experience
                        Chinese culture. Through reading Chinese classic literature, participating in various cultural
                        events, learning traditional Chinese arts and crafts, they can gain a profound understanding and
                        experience of Chinese culture. They can transmit the authentic and profound aspects of Chinese
                        culture to the world.
                        Furthermore, we hope that international students can use their own language and methods to
                        propagate Chinese culture to the world. By using social media platforms, they can share their
                        experiences of life and study in China, allowing more people to learn about China. At the same
                        time, through their actions, they can showcase the values and spirit of Chinese culture,
                        enabling more people to feel the charm of Chinese culture.
                        Chinese culture is extensive and profound. Only with an open and inclusive attitude towards
                        cultural differences and conflicts can effective dissemination of Chinese culture occur. By
                        respecting and understanding the existence and development of different cultures, with an
                        attitude of equality and mutual trust, different cultures can interact and collide. In this way,
                        international students in China can maximize their role in spreading Chinese culture and truly
                        become ambassadors and bridges of cultural exchange, promoting communication and understanding
                        among different cultures.
